      <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Rotator was a casual game I developed over the span of around 4 months near the end of college. Later in development, it was known as Chorae because Rotator was impossible to find on Google.<p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">The goal of the game was to match falling arcs by drawing similar arcs using the mouse (or, if you had one, a stylus/touchscreen).<p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">By the end of development the game had around two dozen gameplay modes. It was fun, but difficult to control with a regular mouse. I was forced to abandon the project upon starting work at ArenaNet due to a non-competition agreement.<p>
